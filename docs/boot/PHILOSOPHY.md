# Soapine's philosophy
Soapine is meant to be lightweight, while being useful to everyone:

* Ship the bootloader with multiple features (even the weirdest features)
* Ability to extend the bootloader with ELF extensions: If you wanna write an extension to support PE loading, ***DO IT***.

Soapine is also meant to be customizable:

* You can modify each bit of the bootloader: If you wanna center the headerbar text, you ***CAN***
* You can change the default values in Soapine's source code.
