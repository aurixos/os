## Getting Started

Latest official releases of AurixOS are available for download [here](https://github.com/aurixos/os/releases).

### Prerequisites

If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed, simply run `brew bundle` to install **all** required build dependencies (incl. packages to build AurixOS for every supported architecture).
Alternatively, read the [Brewfile](Brewfile) in the root of this repository and install the required (and optional) packages manually.

### Building

To build AurixOS, simply run `make` in the root directory of this repository.
To change the build target, run `make ARCH=arch PLATFORM=platform`, where `arch` is the target architecture, and `platform` is the target platform (Default is set to `x86_64`/`generic-pc`).

#### Possible/planned targets:
##### i686 / x86_64
- `generic-pc`

##### arm32 (not available yet)
- `raspi2`

##### aarch64
- `raspi3` (not available yet)
- `raspi4` (limited support)
- `raspi5` (not available yet)

> [!NOTE]  
> On x86(_64) architectures, a UEFI bootloader will be automatically built and packaged together together with a legacy stub. On arm32 and aarch64, invoke Make with `NOUEFI=n` modifier to create a UEFI-capable image.

Inputting an invalid architecture/platform combination will result in an error.

Building AurixOS images is also supported with Make recipes:
- `livecd` builds a CD-ROM image (.iso)
- `livehdd` builds a HDD image (.img)
- `livesd` builds an SD Card image (.img)

Please note that not all bootable images can be created for all platforms (eg. `rpi4` only supports creating an SD Card image). Any attempt at creating an unsupported image will result in an error.

All generated images reside in the `release/` directory and follow this naming scheme:
`aurixos-live[MEDIA]-[GIT_REV]_[ARCH]-[PLATFORM].iso`

`make help` shows you all available build options

## Running

To run AurixOS on QEMU, run `make run` (optionally, append `ARCH=arch PLATFORM=platform` if you're building/running AurixOS on an architecture other than x86_64).

Alternatively, you can boot AurixOS on a physical machine by running `dd if=release/<usb-image>.img of=/dev/<target USB drive> bs=1M` and booting off of this USB drive.

## Support
